  This is the template for the OSD ro-crates. This index.html file is used as the default
  entry point for the github pages and inherits all the styling from the template
  jekyll project this was forked from. 

  The jekyll building tool would need to cp/mv the README.md and ro-crate-preview.html
  files from the OSD project into the correct paths for this to work.
